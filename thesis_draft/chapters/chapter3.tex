\chapter{Learned Quantization\label{cha:chapter3}}
This chapter presents the custom methods of learned quantization developed to address the challenges posed by non-differentiability, 
while enabling the model to make informed decisions on whether to proceed with quantization or revert to preserve performance.
The first section will discuss the \textit{custom quantization layers} written in Tensorflow that can easily be
integrated to existing workflows and directly deal with gradient calculation. The next section provides details on the \textit{custom loss functions} as 
an alternative approach to learned quantization.

\textit{This chapter elaborates on the problem that this thesis tries to solve and explains the individual methods used for solving the problem. }

\section{Custom Quantization Layers}
\label{sec:customlayer}
In this section, we introduce custom layers built upon Tensorflow's \texttt{tf.keras.Layer} class, 
which serves as the base for all Keras layers. Each custom layer also leverages Tensorflow's 
\texttt{tf.custom\_gradient} decorator to define its own gradient computation.
For clarity, the upcoming subsections start by showing how to define the corresponding standard, 
non-quantized layer using \texttt{tf.keras.Layer} and \texttt{tf.customg\_gradient},
then move on to the specific quantized implementations.

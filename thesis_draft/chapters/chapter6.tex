\chapter{Conclusions\label{cha:chapter6}}

Bullet points:
- not all layers react similarly to quantization. This gives room for experimenting with
different thresholds for different Layers
- combined scenarios are not tested 
- could be tested on standard networks like ALexNet
- The scale updates will potentially be improved by some kind of normalization/heuristics
